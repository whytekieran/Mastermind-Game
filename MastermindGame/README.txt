 binary file code is commented out at bottom with small
 instructions on how to change over to it, if you wish
-Inside the selectedColoursOutput function you can copy the code(instructions above code in project) and place 
 it underneath the generateRandomColours() function inside the mainGameplay function, it shows what the
 computer has generated. Just change userChoices to compChoices.
